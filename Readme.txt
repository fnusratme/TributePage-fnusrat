Project: Tribute Page

Background: A tribute page dedicated to H.G. Wells.

Detail: This page is build using HTML, CSS and JavaScripts. I've also used "CSS @media Rule" to make the page responsive. 
The page has only go to top button made using javascript. I've also used google font api to apply fonts on the web page. User can easily navigate through the page, can use the go to top button and check out related links to know more about the author from the tribute page.
